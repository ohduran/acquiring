# Acquiring

Acquiring is a versatile package for accepting payments in your project, be it Django, Flask or FastAPI.

## Working in Units

This project was born out of the talk [Working in Units: How to Decouple the Database and Domain Layers in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLQoxqENbgg). The talk addressed the architectural patterns required to build a Web Development project in Python that was agnostic to the way data is persisted in the database. This pattern was introduced in the context of a system for acquiring payments, and it was natural to follow up with a concrete example.
